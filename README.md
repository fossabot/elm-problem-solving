Artificial intelligence in [Elm](https://elm-lang.org/).

This module roughly follows the standard textbook [*Artificial Intelligence - A Modern Approach*](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/) (*AIMA*) by Stuart Russell and Peter Norvig. The module is also influenced by [aima.js](https://github.com/davidpomerenke/aima.js).
